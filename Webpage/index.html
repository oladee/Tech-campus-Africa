        This is a symbolic park named after the iconic legend, Chief Gani Fawehinmi. A lawyer per excellence and an advocate for the common man, <br>
        Today, the park service is a melting pot fot all the struggles emanating in the mega city (Lagos) in <strong><em>2010</em></strong>, a park in Ojota was named after him by the <strong>Lagos state government</strong> <br>

    <p>I went to the park to take pictures for my photography assignment. I'm really proud such site of attraction was dedicated to Gani Fawehimi <br>
    He was a man of Honor and justice</p>
    <p>
        The park had beautiful sceneries thiught it needs more security because of the Ojota opportunists. It requires maintenence too. But overall I loved it
